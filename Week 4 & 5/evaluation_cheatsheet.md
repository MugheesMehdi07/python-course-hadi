# Evaluation Metrics and Model Fine-Tuning Cheat Sheet

Evaluating the performance of machine learning models is crucial for determining their effectiveness and for guiding the selection of models and their fine-tuning. This cheat sheet provides an overview of common evaluation metrics and parameters for fine-tuning.

## Classification Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of correct predictions. Best for balanced datasets.
  - Fine-tuning: Adjust class weights, threshold tuning.
- **Precision, Recall, F1 Score**: Use when dealing with imbalanced datasets. Precision is the accuracy of positive predictions, recall (sensitivity) measures the ability to find all positive instances, and F1 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
  - Fine-tuning: Threshold adjustments, consider SMOTE for handling imbalances.
- **ROC-AUC**: The area under the ROC curve. Useful for binary classification problems.
  - Fine-tuning: Adjust decision thresholds, use cost-sensitive learning.

## Regression Metrics

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values. Good for understanding the average error magnitude.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: MSE is the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. RMSE is the square root of MSE. Use when larger errors are particularly undesirable.
  - Fine-tuning: Regularization techniques (L1, L2), adjusting learning rate.

## Clustering Metrics

- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. Use to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Davies-Bouldin Index**: The average 'similarity' between clusters, where the similarity is a measure that compares the distance between clusters with the size of the clusters themselves. Lower values indicate better clustering.
  - Fine-tuning: Experiment with different numbers of clusters, initial cluster centroids.

## Deep Learning Metrics

- **Accuracy**: As with classification, but pay attention to overfitting.
- **Loss**: Monitoring the training and validation loss provides insight into learning effectiveness.
  - Fine-tuning: Adjust learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, dropout rates, layer sizes.

## Model Fine-Tuning Parameters

- **Learning Rate**: Controls the size of the steps taken during optimization. Too high can cause diverging, too low can cause slow convergence.
- **Regularization (L1, L2, Dropout)**: Helps prevent overfitting by penalizing complex models.
- **Batch Size**: Impacts the stability of the training process and speed of convergence.
- **Number of Epochs**: Determines how many times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.
- **Class Weights/Imbalance Handling**: Adjust weights or use techniques like SMOTE for imbalanced datasets.

Remember, the choice of metric and parameters for fine-tuning should align with the specific characteristics of your data and the objective of your machine learning project. Experimentation and cross-validation are key to finding the optimal setup.

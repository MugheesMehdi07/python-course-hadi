## Supervised Learning

### Regression

- **Linear Regression**: Use for linear relationships between predictors and the target variable.
- **Ridge/Lasso Regression**: Use when dealing with multicollinearity or to enforce sparsity.
- **Decision Trees**: Good for non-linear data with complex relationships.
- **Random Forest**: Use for higher accuracy through ensemble learning. Handles overfitting better than decision trees.
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**: Use for improved accuracy if computational resources allow.

### Classification

- **Logistic Regression**: Use for binary classification problems.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Simple and effective, but computationally expensive as dataset size grows.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces and for cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.
- **Decision Trees**: Good for interpretability but prone to overfitting.
- **Random Forest**: A go-to model for classification problems. Good balance between accuracy and interpretability.
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**: Often provides predictive accuracy that cannot be beat.

## Unsupervised Learning

### Clustering

- **K-Means**: Use for partitioning data into k distinct clusters. Simple and fast.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Good for identifying hierarchical relationships in data.
- **DBSCAN**: Effective for datasets with clusters of similar density.

### Dimensionality Reduction

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Use for reducing dimensionality while retaining as much variance as possible.
- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: Use for visualization of high-dimensional datasets.
- **Autoencoders**: Deep learning-based approach for dimensionality reduction and feature learning.

## Recommendation Systems

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Use for recommendations based on user similarity or item similarity.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Use when you have detailed information about the items being recommended.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combine collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation quality.

## Deep Learning

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Best for image and video recognition tasks.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks**: Ideal for sequential data such as time series or natural language.
- **Transformer Models (e.g., BERT, GPT)**: State-of-the-art for many NLP tasks.

This cheat sheet aims to provide a starting point for selecting a machine learning model. The choice of model depends on the specific requirements of your dataset and problem, as well as the computational resources available to you.
